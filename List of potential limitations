List of potential limitations and problems that could arise while implementing the described solution:

Governor Limits: Salesforce limits the number of callouts, CPU time, and queries. Large data volumes or excessive API calls could hit these limits.

Error Handling: Inadequate error handling might lead to issues in identifying and resolving failures during callouts.

Test Coverage: Achieving comprehensive test coverage, especially for callouts and error scenarios, can be challenging.

Scalability: Handling a large number of fulfilled orders might cause performance issues or timeouts during callouts.

Duplicate Email Prevention: Ensuring customers don't receive duplicate emails might require sophisticated tracking mechanisms.

Flow Triggers: Managing the Flow trigger logic to execute the Invocable Apex Action accurately on Order Status change might need careful consideration and testing.

Code Maintainability: Ensuring the code is maintainable and easily understandable for future updates or enhancements.

Addressing these limitations would involve robust error handling, efficient data processing, implementing appropriate test scenarios, and creating scalable solutions.
