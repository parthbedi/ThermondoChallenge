Layering code involves organizing functionality into different layers to improve maintainability, scalability, and readability.

Presentation Layer (Flow):
Handles the user interface and triggers the Invocable Apex Action on Order Status change.

Service Layer (NPSIntegration):
Invocable Apex Action that accepts Order Record Ids, retrieves necessary data, and performs the HTTP callouts to the NPS Service.

Data Access Layer (OrderDataProvider):
Handles the retrieval of Order and Contact data needed for the NPS integration.

Integration Layer (NPSApiService):
Manages the actual HTTP callouts to the NPS Service and handles response handling.

By separating concerns into these layers, each layer has a specific responsibility, making the code more modular, easier to maintain, and enhancing its scalability. The Service Layer acts as the orchestrator, coordinating actions between the other layers.
